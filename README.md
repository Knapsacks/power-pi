###Optimizing Power switches for Phantom Load

##Background

No Consumer Electronic device is Ideal. That is, some electrical energy is lost in the form of dissipation (like eddy current loss, joules heating los, hysteresis etc.) Similarly, devices also lose energy while idling. That is, on standby mode. In technical terms, this is also called No Load Power, Vampire Power, Phantom Load or Leaking electricity.



On a macroscopic scale, such taken for granted tiny idling load accounts for enormous power wastage over time.
